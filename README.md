# BadUSB firmware for Phison 2307 (UNFINISHED)

## What it is?
This firmware can turn your Phison 2307 based flash drive into a HID device. This project is an attempt to make a patch for another old ps2307 firmware repository. This patch should adapt it for new versions of Windows and improve the readability of the code.

## How to use?
Soon...
