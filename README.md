# BadUSB firmware for Phison 2307 (UNFINISHED)

## What it is?
This firmware can turn your Phison 2307 based flash drive into a HID device. This project is an attempt to make a patch for another old ps2307 firmware repository. This patch should adapt it for new versions of Windows and improve the readability of the code.

## Status:
The device manager is detected correctly in Windows, there are no warnings, but there may be an error in the endpoint configuration. Keystrokes from the flash drive are not transferred to the host.

## How to use?
Soon...

## Gratitude:
Thanks to [bidhata](https://github.com/bidhata) with his repository [phison-2307-BadUSB](https://github.com/bidhata/phison-2307-BadUSB).
